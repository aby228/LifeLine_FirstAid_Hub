    <h2 id="about">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        LifeLine First Aid Hub bridges the critical gap between medical emergencies and professional help by delivering
        accessible,
        step-by-step emergency medical guidance to anyone, anywhere.
        Originally <em>Novata</em> conceived to serve rural communities in developing countries where healthcare access
        is limited, this project has evolved into a comprehensive platform that welcomes learners from all
        backgrounds‚Äîstudents, educators, healthcare professionals, and community volunteers alike.
        The website serves as both an educational resource and the central hub for our upcoming mobile application,
        featuring interactive first aid tutorials, project updates, and community feedback channels.
        Whether you're a researcher seeking reliable medical protocols or someone who simply wants to be prepared for
        life's unexpected moments, LifeLine provides the tools and knowledge needed to respond confidently when every
        second counts.

            <h3>Emergency Response Timeline</h3>
            <p>This guide breaks down the crucial first 20 minutes of emergency response into five color-coded phases,
                from
                immediate assessment to professional medical handover. Each phase shows specific timing and actions,
                helping
                responders understand how individual first aid techniques fit together in a coordinated, time-sensitive
                response

            <h3>Treatment Decision Flowchart</h3>
            <p>This flowchart guides first aid responders through critical decision points, from checking consciousness
                to
                determining injury severity and appropriate treatment responses. The color-coded pathways help users
                quickly
                navigate complex emergency situations and confidently decide when to apply first aid versus when to
                immediately
                call for professional help.</p>
